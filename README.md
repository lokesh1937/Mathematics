# Mathematics
This project is a C++ library for performing various mathematical and statistical operations. It includes modules for number theory, statistics, and number operations, making it useful for students, educators, and developers working on mathematical applications.

Features
Number theory functions (prime checking, GCD, LCM,Prime modulus(fermats little theorem) etc.)
Statistical calculations (mean, median, mode, percentiles,Interquantile range,outlier boundary etc..)
Number operations (basic arithmetic, advanced manipulations)
